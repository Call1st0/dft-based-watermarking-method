# DFT-based watermarking method using Gray Component Replacement
The demand for security of shared digital and printed images is increasing year over year. There is a need for the robust watermarking scheme which is capable of offering high detection rates even for very aggressive attacks such as Print-Scan process. Yet the perceptibility of the watermark is usually restricting robustness of the watermarking scheme. In this paper a novel DFT based watermarking method with Gray Component Replacement (GCR) masking is proposed. The watermark is additively embedded in the magnitude coefficients of the image within the Fourier domain and then masked using GCR masking to hide the artefacts introduced by the embedding. Experimental results show that GCR masking is capable of completely hide introduced artefacts and increase perceived quality of the watermarked image using both objective and subjective measures. It also outperforms similar state-of-the-art methods in respect to robustness against image attacks. The method is especially suited for printing since the watermark is hidden in visual part of the electromagnetic spectrum but is detectable in infra-red (IR) part of spectrum using IR or hyper-spectral camera. Finally, proposed watermarking method with GCR masking enables the embedding of strong and robust watermark and avoids the introduction of visible artefacts.
